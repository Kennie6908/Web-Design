					<p> Hikaru Nakamura was born December 9, 1987 in Hirakata, Japan. His family moved to the United States when Hikaru was just two years old. Since then, he has always competed under the United States Federation.   </p>
					<p> Nakamura has been one of the world’s top players for over a decade. He was clearly the top American player for much of that time, and is now a key contributor to one of the strongest chess scenes in the world. </p>
					<p>He is a five-time U.S. champion, claiming the title in 2005, 2009, 2012, 2015, and 2019. Only Samuel Reshevsky and Bobby Fischer (eight each) and Walter Browne (six) have won more U.S. Championships since the tournament format began in 1936. </p>
					<p>A great player at standard time controls, Nakamura’s star shines even brighter in rapid and blitz. As of August 2019, he is 19th in FIDE's world rankings at standard, 3rd in the world at rapid, and 3rd in the world at blitz. In addition to his wins in the Paris and St. Louis legs of the 2018 Grand Chess Tour, he has finished third in the 2014 and 2018 World Blitz Chess Championships. </p>

					<p> Nakamura became a National Master (USCF) in 1998, an International Master in 2001, and Grandmaster in 2003. At the time, he was the youngest American grandmaster since Fischer.</p>

					<p>In 2003 he participated in his first U.S. Championship tournament, scoring +3 -1 =5 in the event, which was won by Alexander Shabalov. In January 2004, Nakamura played in Group B at the Corus tournament and finished fourth with a plus score on his way to cracking the 2600 rating threshold in June. By October, he was in the world’s top 100 for the first time. </p>

					<p>He achieved the 2600 mark during FIDE’s 2004 knockout tournament to determine its champion. As the 83rd seed, Nakamura defeated higher-rated opponents Sergei Volkov, Aleksej Aleksandrov, and Alexander Lastin to become one of the last 16 players. In that round, he fell to third seed and eventual finalist Michael Adams, who entered the tournament with a 150-point rating advantage. </p>

					<p> The crowning achievement, so far, of Nakamura’s career may have been his performance at Wijk aan Zee in 2011. He won with a +6 -1 =6 score, clearing a field that included world champions past, present, and future (Vladimir Kramnik, Viswanathan Anand and Magnus Carlsen). Nakamura only scored two draws and a loss against them (and fair enough: they were the first-, second-, and fourth-highest rated players in the world entering the tournament!), but dominated the remainder of the field, including a 33-move win against Maxime Vachier-Lagrave. Nakamura’s rating climbed 23 points in the tournament, from 2751 to 2774. </p>
					
					<p>Also a contender for Nakamura’s best-ever event, considering the circumstances, was his joint first-place finish at Khanty-Mansiysk in May 2015 (achieved with a +2 -0 =9 score). It was the final event of the 2014-15 FIDE Grand Prix and Nakamura needed the result to earn second place in the overall event and thus qualify for the 2016 Candidates tournament.</p>

					<p>After his performance at Khanty-Mansiysk, Nakamura achieved the coveted 2800 rating on the June 2015 FIDE rating list, with a 2802 after years of flirting with the mark. His rating would reach its peak, 2816, on the October 2015 list. At that point, only Carlsen had a higher standard rating in the entire world.</p>

					<p> In September 2016, Nakamura played second board for the United States in the 42nd Chess Olympiad. Among second board players, only Kramnik had a stronger rating entering the Olympiad. Nakamura scored +5 -1 =5 in the event to help the Americans win the competition for the first time since 1976.  </p>
					
					<p>In 2018, Nakamura placed first at the Grand Chess Tour in 2018. It being dominated by rapid and blitz events played into Nakamura’s strengths, and his first place finishes at Paris in June and St. Louis in August helped qualify him for the four-player finals at the London Chess Classic. There he defeated Caruana and Vachier-Lagrave to win the whole event.</p>
					
					<p>The U.S. championship, hotly contested by Wesley So and Fabiano Caruana, makes Nakamura’s 2019 triumph perhaps his most impressive U.S. title yet. Nakamura used the Dutch Defense to defeat Jeffery Xiong with the black pieces in the final round, while Caruana and Domínguez could only draw their games. As a result, Nakamura’s +5 -0 =6 score was enough to beat Caruana and Domínguez by a half-point each. </p>

					<p> Despite losing ground in the classical rating list since his late 2015 peak, Nakamura’s performances in the 2018 Grand Chess Tour and 2019 U.S. Championship indicate a player who to this day remains more than capable of strong play against fellow Super GM’s. </p>

					<p>Given that he has represented the United States so well for so long from such a young age, Nakamura has long been thought of as its next potential world champion. Caruana, having already been a challenger, appears to have surpassed him, but Nakamura remains a threat.</p>
					
					<p> Currently Nakamura streams daily on Twitch, a video live-streaming platform. You can check him out at <a href = "https://www.twitch.tv/gmhikaru" target="_blank">this link.</a></p>
