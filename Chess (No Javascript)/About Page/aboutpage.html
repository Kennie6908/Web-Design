		<h2> <u> About The PlayerBase:</u></h2>
		<p>The Chess PlayerBase was created in May 2020, by two close friends named Alex and Michael. Their goal was to make a database detailing the achievements of all chess players, past and present. This database would be completely run, edited, and kept up-to-date by its community; many selfless volunteers willing to give up hours to preserve chess history for the next century. </p>
		<p> As of July 2020, there have already been 500+ registered users with 21 player biographies fully written. There will be more coming in the near future. </p>
		<p>We are completely ad-free and community-funded. Without our gracious supporters, this website would not be possible. Thank you all! </p>
