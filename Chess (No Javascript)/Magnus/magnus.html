				<div class= "content">
					<p> Magnus Carlsen is the current World Chess Champion. To many people, he’s the best to ever play the game, although Garry Kasparov and Bobby Fischer remain in the conversation. At any rate, the clear and remarkable point is that before turning 30 years old, Carlsen has already earned a spot at the top. </p>

					<p> It’s easy to see why. The 13-year-old Norwegian prodigy drew Kasparov and defeated Anatoly Karpov at the same event in 2004, one month before he became the second-youngest GM in history. In 2009, he became the youngest player to break the 2800-rating threshold.</p>

					<p>Then Carlsen transitioned from young world-class player to all-time great. He captured the world number-one ranking in 2011 and still hasn’t let go of it. He won the world title and successfully defended it three times. Additionally, he won multiple world titles in rapid (twice) and blitz (four times) time controls, achieved the highest rating ever and racked up several elite tournament wins, including two Norway Chess victories and seven in Wijk aan Zee.</p>

					<p>The amazing part is it seems like there’s much more ahead for Carlsen. If he continues performing the way he has, Carlsen could create something truly legendary. In an era of chess that’s more competitive than ever, he’s far ahead of the opposition.</p>

					<p>Carlsen learned how to play chess when he was five years old. However, he didn’t show much interest at first. He instead amazed other people by completing activities that demonstrated his general intellectual aptitude at an early age.</p>
					
					<p>Early in his chess career, Carlsen was coached by Norway’s top player, the seven-time national champion Simen Agdestein, who with former Norwegian junior champion Torbjorn Ringdal Hansen helped Carlsen hone his talent quickly. In one year (2000), his rating increased more than 1,000 points, from 904 to 1907.</p>

					<p>It didn’t take long for Carlsen to rack up impressive performances and tournament wins. In July 2000, the nine-year-old won the youngest age group at the Norwegian championship—for players under the age of 11—with a score of 10/11. Shortly thereafter, he took part in a couple events and scored a performance rating of about 1900 in one.</p>

					<p>Then his breakthrough performance came, according to Carlsen and his family. At the Norwegian championship for junior teams in September 2000, he scored 3.5 out of 5 against the country’s top players. Still only nine years old, Carlsen achieved a rating performance of about 2000 in the event.</p>
					
					<p>In 2002 Carlsen continued his upward trajectory. He placed sixth in the Under-12 section of the European Youth Chess Championship, and a few weeks later he tied for first place in the World Youth Chess Championship’s Under-12 section. However, in tiebreaks he lost to Ian Nepomniachtchi, who took the title.</p>

					<p>One year later, Carlsen finished in the top 10 for the same two tournaments (European and World Youth Chess Championship) in the Under-14 sections. He secured three IM norms that year, at the age of 12, to claim his IM title in August 2003. </p>

					<p> The next month, in April, Carlsen got his third and final GM norm. At 13 years, four months and 27 days of age, Carlsen became the youngest grandmaster in the world and the second-youngest grandmaster at the time (after Sergey Karjakin, who still holds the record at exactly 12 years and seven months of age).</p>
					<p>Carlsen’s victory at the Pearl Spring Chess Tournament in Nanjing, China, in October 2009 with 8 out of a possible 10 points was considered one of the all-time best tournament performances. In November he won the World Blitz Championship in Moscow.</p>

					<p>In January 2010 FIDE announced that Carlsen was the top player in the world. He had recently turned 19 and was thus the youngest player to become number one. Carlsen surprised the chess world in November 2010, when he decided to forgo the 2011 Candidate Matches to select a challenger to play against Indian chess player Viswanathan Anand for the world championship, arguing that the championship structure was flawed and that the reigning champion should not receive an automatic spot in the final round.</p>

					<p>However, Carlsen participated in the 2013 Candidates Tournament in London. Despite losing in the final round to Russian player Peter Svidler, he accumulated enough wins earlier in the tournament to best Russian player Vladimir Kramnik (who had the same number of points) and secure the challenger spot against Anand. In November 2013 Carlsen defeated Anand in 10 games at the world championship match in Chennai, India, with a score of 3 wins and 7 draws. Carlsen was the second youngest player (after Kasparov) to win the world title. He successfully defended his title in a rematch against Anand in 2014 in Sochi, Russia, with a score of 3 wins, 7 draws, and 1 loss. </p>

					<p> In October 2015, it was time for Carlsen to defend his world titles in rapid and blitz time controls. He pulled off the former in convincing fashion, taking the rapid championship one point ahead of Leinier Dominguez Perez, Radjabov and Nepomniachtchi. That performance made Carlsen the highest-rated player in all three time controls simultaneously.</p>
					
					<p>The next wave of tournament chess for Carlsen was dominant. He unleashed a series of victories in several top-level events: the London Chess Classic and the Qatar Masters in December 2015, his fifth title at Wijk aan Zee with an undefeated performance in the 2016 Tata Steel Masters in January, his first title at Norway Chess in April 2016, wins in the rapid and blitz portions (to take the overall tournament) of Leuven for the Grand Chess Tour in June 2016 and taking the Bilbao Masters with a round to spare in July 2016.
					Carlsen had an up-and-down year in 2017. Early he had two second-place finishes in Tata Steel 2017 and the Grenke Chess Classic, followed by a nightmare performance in June 2017 at Norway Chess when he finished ninth out of 10 and received his lowest tournament performance rating (2670) since November 2015. Carlsen then started to improve his performance. He beat Vachier-Lagrave in a playoff to clinch the Paris Grand Chess Tour and then a few days later played in the Leuven Grand Chess Tour.</p>
					
					<p>Other victories followed, including the Grenke Chess Classic, Côte d'Ivoire Rapid/Blitz, Lindores Abbey Chess Stars Tournament, Norway Chess and Croatia Grand Chess Tour. The final victory marked Carlsen’s eighth straight tournament win and as a result of his strong play, the world’s number-one returned to his highest rating of 2882 officially in August 2019.</p>

					<p>Carlsen continues to dominate the highest level of chess. Victories in elite tournaments are expected of him, and for the most part, he performs to the incredibly high expectations of the chess world and casual observers. His accomplishments are so impressive that it’s becoming difficult to imagine what’s next for a chess legend who hasn’t turned 30 years old yet.</p>

					<p>Indeed, the amazing part about Carlsen is that he’s accomplished so much in so little time, and still he seems ready for more. What does that look like? Perhaps more time as world champion, more world titles across blitz, rapid and emerging forms of chess like Fischer Random, more titles in elite tournaments like Wijk aan Zee and Norway, more time spent as the top-rated player in the world. Maybe he’ll surpass the 2882 mark he set as the highest chess rating in history. Whatever the case may be, the world may be witnessing how Carlsen makes his case as the best chess player to play the game.</p>
